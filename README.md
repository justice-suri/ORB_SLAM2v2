**13 Jan 2017**: OpenCV 3 and Eigen 3.3 are now supported.

**22 Dec 2016**: Added AR demo (see section 7).

ORB-SLAM2 is a real-time SLAM library for **Monocular**, **Stereo** and **RGB-D** cameras that computes the camera trajectory and a sparse 3D reconstruction (in the stereo and RGB-D case with true scale). It is able to detect loops and relocalize the camera in real time. We provide examples to run the SLAM system in the [KITTI dataset](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_odometry.php) as stereo or monocular, in the [TUM dataset](http://vision.in.tum.de/data/datasets/rgbd-dataset) as RGB-D or monocular, and in the [EuRoC dataset](http://projects.asl.ethz.ch/datasets/doku.php?id=kmavvisualinertialdatasets) as stereo or monocular. We also provide a ROS node to process live monocular, stereo or RGB-D streams. **The library can be compiled without ROS**. ORB-SLAM2 provides a GUI to change between a *SLAM Mode* and *Localization Mode*, see section 9 of this document.

# 2. Prerequisites
We have tested the library in **Ubuntu 12.04**, **14.04** and **16.04**, but it should be easy to compile in other platforms. A powerful computer (e.g. i7) will ensure real-time performance and provide more stable and accurate results.

## C++11 or C++0x Compiler
We use the new thread and chrono functionalities of C++11.

## Pangolin
We use [Pangolin](https://github.com/stevenlovegrove/Pangolin) for visualization and user interface. Dowload and install instructions can be found at: https://github.com/stevenlovegrove/Pangolin.

## OpenCV
We use [OpenCV](http://opencv.org) to manipulate images and features. Dowload and install instructions can be found at: http://opencv.org. **Required at leat 2.4.3. Tested with OpenCV 2.4.11 and OpenCV 3.2**.

## Eigen3
Required by g2o (see below). Download and install instructions can be found at: http://eigen.tuxfamily.org. **Required at least 3.1.0**.

## DBoW2 and g2o (Included in Thirdparty folder)
We use modified versions of the [DBoW2](https://github.com/dorian3d/DBoW2) library to perform place recognition and [g2o](https://github.com/RainerKuemmerle/g2o) library to perform non-linear optimizations. Both modified libraries (which are BSD) are included in the *Thirdparty* folder.

## ROS (optional)
We provide some examples to process the live input of a monocular, stereo or RGB-D camera using [ROS](ros.org). Building these examples is optional. In case you want to use ROS, a version Hydro or newer is needed.

# 7. ROS Examples

### Building the nodes for mono, monoAR, stereo and RGB-D
1. Add the path including *Examples/ROS/ORB_SLAM2* to the ROS_PACKAGE_PATH environment variable. Open .bashrc file and add at the end the following line. Replace PATH by the folder where you cloned ORB_SLAM2:

  ```
  export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=${ROS_PACKAGE_PATH}:PATH/orb_slam2_catkin
  ```
  
2. Execute `catkin build orb_slam2` script inside your catkin workspace:

  ```
 catkin build orb_slam2_catkin
  ```
  
### Running Monocular Node
For a monocular input from topic `/camera/image_raw` run node ORB_SLAM2/Mono. You will need to provide the vocabulary file and a settings file. See the monocular examples above.

  ```
  rosrun orb_slam2_catkin mono_node PATH_TO_VOCABULARY PATH_TO_SETTINGS_FILE
  ```
  

  
### Running Stereo Node
For a stereo input from topic `/camera/left/image_raw` and `/camera/right/image_raw` run node ORB_SLAM2/Stereo. You will need to provide the vocabulary file and a settings file. If you **provide rectification matrices** (see Examples/Stereo/EuRoC.yaml example), the node will recitify the images online, **otherwise images must be pre-rectified**.

  ```
  rosrun orb_slam2_catkin stereo_node PATH_TO_VOCABULARY PATH_TO_SETTINGS_FILE ONLINE_RECTIFICATION
  ```
  
**Example**: Download a rosbag (e.g. V1_01_easy.bag) from the EuRoC dataset (http://projects.asl.ethz.ch/datasets/doku.php?id=kmavvisualinertialdatasets). Open 3 tabs on the terminal and run the following command at each tab:
  ```
  roscore
  ```
  
  ```
  rosrun orb_slam2_catkin stereo_node Vocabulary/ORBvoc.txt Examples/Stereo/EuRoC.yaml true
  ```
  
  ```
  rosbag play --pause V1_01_easy.bag /cam0/image_raw:=/camera/left/image_raw /cam1/image_raw:=/camera/right/image_raw
  ```
  
Once ORB-SLAM2 has loaded the vocabulary, press space in the rosbag tab. Enjoy!. Note: a powerful computer is required to run the most exigent sequences of this dataset.

### Running RGB_D Node
For an RGB-D input from topics `/camera/rgb/image_raw` and `/camera/depth_registered/image_raw`, run node ORB_SLAM2/RGBD. You will need to provide the vocabulary file and a settings file. See the RGB-D example above.

  ```
  rosrun orb_slam2_catkin rgbd_node PATH_TO_VOCABULARY PATH_TO_SETTINGS_FILE
  a launch file is provided for RGBD node:
  roslaunch orb_slam2_catkin orb_slam.launch
  If you want to run mono or stereo modes modify the executable name in the launch file to launch mono and stereo nodes
  ```
  
# 8. Processing your own sequences
You will need to create a settings file with the calibration of your camera. See the settings file provided for the TUM and KITTI datasets for monocular, stereo and RGB-D cameras. We use the calibration model of OpenCV. See the examples to learn how to create a program that makes use of the ORB-SLAM2 library and how to pass images to the SLAM system. Stereo input must be synchronized and rectified. RGB-D input must be synchronized and depth registered.

# 9. SLAM and Localization Modes
You can change between the *SLAM* and *Localization mode* using the GUI of the map viewer.

### SLAM Mode
This is the default mode. The system runs in parallal three threads: Tracking, Local Mapping and Loop Closing. The system localizes the camera, builds new map and tries to close loops.

### Localization Mode
This mode can be used when you have a good map of your working area. In this mode the Local Mapping and Loop Closing are deactivated. The system localizes the camera in the map (which is no longer updated), using relocalization if needed.
